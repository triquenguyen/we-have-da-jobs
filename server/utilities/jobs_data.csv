Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleSocial media is how Notion connects daily with our >20 million users. Given the size of our communities on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and LinkedIn, this role is responsible for creating content for an audience the size of a small country.We have ambitious business goals to make Notion ubiquitous. As a steward of our public channels, you will be a key part of realizing that vision and bringing our brand to life.We're looking for an instinctive storyteller who isn’t afraid to experiment with voice and add a dash of whimsy. As a fluid communicator, you know how to make a brand sing across multiple channels, audiences, and communities.What You'll DoCollaborate. You are a self-starter and a fount of ideas, but also know that successful execution requires managing projects cross-functionally, taking in and prioritizing requests from across the organization, and communicating with all stakeholders. Grow our audience across social channels and spotlight Notion’s employees and thought leaders in creative ways.Strategize. You understand the importance of creating a content ecosystem and even if you haven’t held a formal strategic role, have strategic instincts. You will set the vision for our social platforms, then work cross-functionally to achieve those goals. Leveraging both data and intuition, you'll determine the best ways to educate our audience, deepen their engagement, celebrate their accomplishments, project our brand identity, and trumpet our news — all without falling into rote patterns.Test. You are risk tolerant and love to experiment. The faster we can figure out what works, the sooner we can reach more people in compelling ways. You'll identify social media metrics that map to our goals, determine what type of content we should invest in, and iterate as you go.Expand. You know the audience reach of our current channels, stay on top of emergent channels, and look for opportunities to expand. You'll monitor conversation taking place across our existing channels and help us branch into new ones where we can seed and grow an audience, whether that's Pinterest, Discord, Reddit, or something yet to take off.Write. You'll be reviewing Notion's most important short-form copy every day across Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok and Facebook — and writing some of it yourself. You'll be the steward of our profiles and owner of our social voice and tone, making sure both evolve as fast as we do.Design. You are a scrappy creator and producer who doesn’t make perfect the enemy of good. Notion is very visual and best learned by seeing it in action or in context of who's using it and how. You'll develop ways to express the product and brand visually by creating assets yourself, and work with our top-of-class Creative Studio to bring ideas to life.What We're Looking ForYou've scaled brand accounts before. You’ve been to this rodeo before and are now ready to run it.You've built significant communities. You've amassed a serious following for a brand (or yourself). You know what strategies and tactics work and can bring them to global scale.You’re an expert collaborator. This role interfaces with people across all teams at Notion: product, recruiting, marketing, creative, comms, and more. You know how to craft deep cross-functional relationships to move quickly and deliver top-tier work.You understand both B2B and B2C marketing. Notion’s international user base is diverse. You know how to communicate with everyone from enterprise buyers to college freshmen.You stay up with the trends. You know how fast social can move. Channels rise and fall. Memes come and go. We want our content to feel classic and current.You are allergic to cliches. Notion doesn’t pick fights on Twitter. We don't share meandering “thought leadership” posts on LinkedIn. You know when not to lean in.You are an excellent writer. Compelling communication requires exceptional writing craft. You are a strong writer and have a portfolio that demonstrates distinct brand voice.You bring design to the table. You have experience with creating visual assets — photography, video, motion graphics, illustration, fine art — and can point to numerous projects where you worked side-by-side with design and content teams to create arresting work.Important note: The above is what we suspect the right background might be — but this role is one where there’s really no such thing as “right background.” We'd love to hear from artists and creative producers with all kinds of strengths and ideas.We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleSocial media is how Notion connects daily with our >20 million users. Given the size of our communities on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and LinkedIn, this role is responsible for creating content for an audience the size of a small country.We have ambitious business goals to make Notion ubiquitous. As a steward of our public channels, you will be a key part of realizing that vision and bringing our brand to life.We're looking for an instinctive storyteller who isn’t afraid to experiment with voice and add a dash of whimsy. As a fluid communicator, you know how to make a brand sing across multiple channels, audiences, and communities.What You'll DoCollaborate. You are a self-starter and a fount of ideas, but also know that successful execution requires managing projects cross-functionally, taking in and prioritizing requests from across the organization, and communicating with all stakeholders. Grow our audience across social channels and spotlight Notion’s employees and thought leaders in creative ways.Strategize. You understand the importance of creating a content ecosystem and even if you haven’t held a formal strategic role, have strategic instincts. You will set the vision for our social platforms, then work cross-functionally to achieve those goals. Leveraging both data and intuition, you'll determine the best ways to educate our audience, deepen their engagement, celebrate their accomplishments, project our brand identity, and trumpet our news — all without falling into rote patterns.Test. You are risk tolerant and love to experiment. The faster we can figure out what works, the sooner we can reach more people in compelling ways. You'll identify social media metrics that map to our goals, determine what type of content we should invest in, and iterate as you go.Expand. You know the audience reach of our current channels, stay on top of emergent channels, and look for opportunities to expand. You'll monitor conversation taking place across our existing channels and help us branch into new ones where we can seed and grow an audience, whether that's Pinterest, Discord, Reddit, or something yet to take off.Write. You'll be reviewing Notion's most important short-form copy every day across Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok and Facebook — and writing some of it yourself. You'll be the steward of our profiles and owner of our social voice and tone, making sure both evolve as fast as we do.Design. You are a scrappy creator and producer who doesn’t make perfect the enemy of good. Notion is very visual and best learned by seeing it in action or in context of who's using it and how. You'll develop ways to express the product and brand visually by creating assets yourself, and work with our top-of-class Creative Studio to bring ideas to life.What We're Looking ForYou've scaled brand accounts before. You’ve been to this rodeo before and are now ready to run it.You've built significant communities. You've amassed a serious following for a brand (or yourself). You know what strategies and tactics work and can bring them to global scale.You’re an expert collaborator. This role interfaces with people across all teams at Notion: product, recruiting, marketing, creative, comms, and more. You know how to craft deep cross-functional relationships to move quickly and deliver top-tier work.You understand both B2B and B2C marketing. Notion’s international user base is diverse. You know how to communicate with everyone from enterprise buyers to college freshmen.You stay up with the trends. You know how fast social can move. Channels rise and fall. Memes come and go. We want our content to feel classic and current.You are allergic to cliches. Notion doesn’t pick fights on Twitter. We don't share meandering “thought leadership” posts on LinkedIn. You know when not to lean in.You are an excellent writer. Compelling communication requires exceptional writing craft. You are a strong writer and have a portfolio that demonstrates distinct brand voice.You bring design to the table. You have experience with creating visual assets — photography, video, motion graphics, illustration, fine art — and can point to numerous projects where you worked side-by-side with design and content teams to create arresting work.Important note: The above is what we suspect the right background might be — but this role is one where there’s really no such thing as “right background.” We'd love to hear from artists and creative producers with all kinds of strengths and ideas.We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

As a pioneer in automated investing and money management, Wealthfront offers tools and services to make more of those dreams possible for a broader range of people than ever before. The Creative Team at Wealthfront is searching for a Designer to help us find innovative, engaging ways to bring our brand promise to life with conceptual flair and impeccable execution.You’ll be responsible for creating a wide range of awesome things: producing assets to support a tentpole brand campaign and ongoing marketing experiments, dreaming up unexpected (and unexpectedly fun) ways to illustrate complicated financial concepts and delivering the kinds of creative ideas that no one would ever expect from a financial institution.Our Designer will be a hands-on builder, well-versed in Figma and the Adobe Suite, who nit-picks pixels and never settles until the typography is perfect.About YouYou believe in our missionYou know that money can be both intimidating and empowering, and you feel invested in Wealthfront’s vision of how well-managed finances can reduce worry and enable our clients to live their lives more fully. You are motivated to make a meaningful impact, to improve the financial system, and to do your part to define a brand working to do just that.You sweat the small stuffYou recognize that the line between ok and exceptional can be very very thin, and you work ceaselessly to stay on the correct side of it. You make considered decisions in your work, can defend your creative choices, and are ready to revise your opinions in the face of compelling arguments because you care — deeply — about making the work the best it can be. You have high expectations for yourself and the people around you.You expect your work to serve the teamYou know that your way isn’t always the right way, and you’re eager to find a way to contribute, even when it might be outside your typical skill set. You understand there’s always more you can learn, and you look forward to opportunities to add to your creative arsenal.You are resourceful and enterprisingYou think like an owner, are solutions-oriented and adapt quickly to the constraints and challenges of a fast-paced, rapidly growing business with a small team.You create memorable, engaging things that might-or-might-not look like marketing.You have experience finding the moments that bring a brand to life. You’re happy designing matchbooks, Instagram ads, emails, billboards and everything both in between and beyond. Whether big or small, you look for ways to intersect consumers’ lives to communicate a brand truth in a way that feels relevant, authentic, and memorable, regardless of channel or medium.Preferred ExperienceA few years of experience as a designer in an agency, production studio, or in-house creative teamDemonstrated expertise in Figma and the Adobe Creative SuiteExperience working across media channels, including digital, print and non-traditional mediaSome combination of motion graphics, illustration, photography/videography, and/or video editing skills a plusEstimated annual salary range: $105,000 - $120,000 USD plus equity and discretionary bonus.Benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and moreAbout WealthfrontWealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built one of the first automated investment products that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee. We then expanded. We now work with partner banks to offer exceptional banking features through a Wealthfront Brokerage Cash Account, which makes it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $50 billion of our client’s hard earned money, pioneering the robo-advisor category and transforming the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially in a way that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.For more information please visit www.wealthfront.com .We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
